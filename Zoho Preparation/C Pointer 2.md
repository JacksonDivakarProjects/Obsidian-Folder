## 📘 Notes: `int* arr[10][20]` and `sizeof(*arr)`

---

### 🔹 Declaration:

```c
int* arr[10][20];
```

- This is a **2D array** of **pointers to int**
    
- Total elements = `10 × 20 = 200`
    
- Each element is of type: `int*` (pointer to int)
    

---

### 🔹 Type Analysis:

|Expression|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`arr`|`int* [10][20]`|2D array of int pointers|
|`*arr`|`int* [20]`|1st row (array of 20 int*)|
|`arr[0][0]`|`int*`|A single pointer to int|

---

### 🔹 Size Analysis (Assuming 64-bit system):

|Expression|Meaning|Size (Bytes)|
|---|---|---|
|`sizeof(arr)`|Entire 2D array → `10 × 20 × 8`|`1600`|
|`sizeof(*arr)`|One row of 20 int pointers → `20 × 8`|`160`|
|`sizeof(arr[0][0])`|One pointer to int|`8`|

---

### 🧠 Memory Layout:

```
arr: [
  [int*, int*, ..., int*],  // row 0 → *arr
  ...
  [int*, int*, ..., int*]   // row 9
]
```

- Each row: 20 `int*` pointers
    
- Each pointer: 8 bytes on 64-bit systems
    

---

### ✅ Summary:

- `*arr` → one full row (`int* [20]`)
    
- `sizeof(*arr)` → size of that row = `160 bytes`
    
- `sizeof(arr)` → size of entire 2D array = `1600 bytes`

Excellent — this is the **core difference** between arrays of pointers and pointers to arrays, and it's what separates beginner C coders from advanced ones. Let’s settle this once and for all.

---

## ✅ Context 1: Pointer to a 2D Array

### 🔷 Code:

```c
int (*p)[10][20];
```

### 🔍 Type meaning:

- `p` is a **pointer to a 2D array** of type `int[10][20]`
    

---

### 🔷 `*p`:

- Dereferencing `p` gives the **entire 2D array**:
    

```c
*p → int[10][20]
```

- So:
    

```c
sizeof(*p) = 10 × 20 × sizeof(int) = 10 × 20 × 4 = 800 bytes
```

✅ `*p` means: _entire 2D array of ints_

---

## ❗Common Misunderstanding

You might think:

> _"Isn't `*p` just one row, like in `int* arr[10][20]`?"_

### ❌ No, because:

- In `int (*p)[10][20]`, `p` is a **pointer to the entire 2D block**
    
- In contrast, in `int* arr[10][20]`, `arr` is an **array of pointers**
    

---

## 🔄 Comparison Table

|Declaration|`p` Type|`*p` Type|`sizeof(*p)`|
|---|---|---|---|
|`int (*p)[10][20];`|pointer to array|`int[10][20]`|`800` (10×20×4)|
|`int* arr[10][20];`|array of pointers|`int*[20]`|`160` (20×8)|

---

## 🔥 Visual Mental Model

### `int (*p)[10][20]`:

```
p →  -------------------------
      | int[10][20] block     |
      -------------------------
```

### `int* arr[10][20]`:

```
arr → row0 → [int*, int*, ..., int*]  (20 pointers)
     row1 → [int*, int*, ..., int*]
     ...
```

---

## 🧠 Final Takeaway

- `*p` is **not always** one row.
    
- It depends on what `p` **points to**.
    
- If `p` points to a full array, then `*p` is that full array.
    
- If `p` **is** an array (like `int* arr[10][20]`), then `*arr` is one row.

# Array Pointer Note


🔥 You're asking the **exact right question**, Jack — this shows you're _not memorizing_, you're truly understanding **how pointers and arrays behave in memory**.

Let's now clear this **once and for all** — no confusion from now on. I’ll explain **step-by-step with logic**, not just "rules".

---

## 🔷 Given:

```c
int (*p)[10][20];
```

This line **declares**:

- `p` is a **pointer to a 2D array** of type `int[10][20]`
    

---

## 🔍 What is `p` and what does it _refer to_?

|Expression|Meaning|Type|
|---|---|---|
|`p`|Holds address of a full array `int[10][20]`|`int (*)[10][20]`|
|`*p`|Dereferenced → the actual 2D array|`int[10][20]`|
|`**p`|A row of 20 ints|`int[20]`|
|`***p`|A single integer|`int`|

---

## ✅ Why `sizeof(p)` gives **8**

- `p` is just a **pointer variable** — it stores an address.
    
- On a 64-bit system, a pointer takes **8 bytes**.
    
- So:
    

```c
sizeof(p) = 8
```

🧠 Even though `p` "points to a big array", the variable `p` itself is just a pointer = 8 bytes.

---

## ✅ Why `sizeof(*p)` gives **800**

- `*p` dereferences the pointer → now you're looking at the **entire 2D array**:
    

```c
*p → int[10][20]
```

So:

```c
sizeof(*p) = 10 × 20 × sizeof(int) = 800 bytes
```

---

## 🧠 Your Question:

> We usually `printf("%p", p)` and it gives 8-byte address.  
> Then why `sizeof(*p)` gives array size — isn’t that confusing?

No — and here's the **KEY INSIGHT**:

### 💡 `sizeof(p)` vs `sizeof(*p)` is about **type**, not value.

- `sizeof(p)` → "Hey C, what's the size of a pointer to `int[10][20]`?"  
    → C says: "That's a pointer. Pointer = 8 bytes."
    
- `sizeof(*p)` → "What's the size of the actual thing this pointer points to?"  
    → C says: "That’s an array of 10×20 ints. Each int = 4 bytes → total = 800."
    

> ✅ So:  
> 👉 `p` = pointer → `sizeof(p)` = 8  
> 👉 `*p` = full 2D array → `sizeof(*p)` = 800

---

## 📌 Summary Table

|Expression|Means|Type|sizeof (64-bit)|
|---|---|---|---|
|`p`|Pointer to array|`int (*)[10][20]`|8 bytes|
|`*p`|The full 2D array|`int[10][20]`|800 bytes|
|`**p`|One row of 20 ints|`int[20]`|80 bytes|
|`***p`|A single integer|`int`|4 bytes|

---

## ✅ Why we use `sizeof(*p)` instead of just `sizeof(p)`?

Because:

- `sizeof(p)` → tells you size of pointer (just memory of the address)
    
- `sizeof(*p)` → tells you size of **actual array data**
    

So if you're allocating, copying, or doing math on the actual array memory — use `sizeof(*p)`.

---

Would you like me to make a diagram showing `p`, `*p`, `**p`, etc. in memory? That will permanently lock it in your head.




---
Exactly right, Jack — you're getting it now. Let’s walk through this one last time in crystal-clear form. Yes:

> ✅ **`p` stores `&arr` (the address of the array)**  
> ✅ **`p` is just 8 bytes** (it's a pointer)  
> ✅ **`*p` accesses the whole original array (`int[10][20]`)**  
> ✅ That array is large — **800 bytes** total.

---

### 🧠 Let’s rephrase in real-world analogy:

> Think of `p` as a **bookmark** that points to a **big book (the array)**

- The **bookmark** (pointer) is small — 8 bytes
    
- The **book** (array) is big — 800 bytes
    
- `*p` → says, "Give me the book that the bookmark is pointing to"
    

---

## 🔍 Code Setup:

```c
int arr[10][20];
int (*p)[10][20] = &arr;
```

|Variable|What it stores|Type|Size (64-bit)|
|---|---|---|---|
|`p`|Address of `arr` (`&arr`)|`int (*)[10][20]`|8 bytes|
|`*p`|The array `arr` itself|`int[10][20]`|800 bytes|

---

### ✅ Now:

|Expression|Meaning|Result|
|---|---|---|
|`sizeof(p)`|Size of pointer (just holds an address)|8 bytes|
|`sizeof(*p)`|Size of entire 2D array|10 × 20 × 4 = **800 bytes**|

---

### 🔧 Why `*p` works:

Because you're saying:

> "Take the address of the array (`&arr`) and store it in `p`. Now `*p` will give me access to the actual array."

So yes, **pointer small** (8 bytes), **data large** (800 bytes).

---

### ✅ Summary:

- `p = &arr` → pointer stores array address
    
- `p` → 8 bytes
    
- `*p` → the full array = 800 bytes
    
- Use `*p` when you want to **access array**, not just **address**
