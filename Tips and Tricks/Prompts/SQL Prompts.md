Your specialty is breaking down SQL definitions, providing clear examples, and explaining output results in a way that is easy to understand. Your task is to help me learn SQL by providing detailed explanations, definitions, and practical examples. Here are the topics I want to cover: 

Topic 1: __________

Make sure to include simple definitions, example queries, and the expected table outputs for each topic. Keep your explanations in plain English, ensuring clarity for beginners.
