# Linux Masterclass Concepts

This masterclass aims to provide foundational, intermediate, and advanced Linux knowledge essential for roles such as Data Engineer, Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and AI/ML Engineer. The instructor, Gautham, has 11 years of experience in Big Data Engineering and various tech stacks.

## 1. Why Linux is Essential
*   **Work Environment:** All servers today run on Linux because it is free and open-source. If your server is Linux, you must know Linux.
*   **Industry Standard:** Linux is used everywhere: in distributed environments, computing clusters, cloud computing (AWS, Azure, GCP), DevOps, supercomputers, and smartphones (Android).
*   **Career Advantage:** While Linux questions may not be heavily featured in interviews, knowing Linux creates a strong impression with colleagues, leads, and managers, especially as many freshers lack this knowledge. It's a foundational skill, much like knowing how to open a folder in Windows.
*   **Remote Servers:** When connecting to remote Linux servers, you will primarily use a **command-line interface (CLI)**, a black terminal window, as there is no graphical user interface (GUI). Therefore, commands are crucial.

## 2. Core Concepts
*   **Open Source:** Something that is free to use, develop, and redistribute. Anyone can use the code, build upon it, and release new versions. Record of authorship is maintained through platforms like GitHub or licensing bodies such as Apache, Free Software Foundation (FSF), and Open Source Initiative (OSI). Open source provides opportunities for developers, even if directly monetizing the code is not the primary goal.
*   **Linux vs. Unix:**
    *   **Linux:** Free, open-source operating system based on Unix principles. Created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Community-driven development. Examples include Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Arch Linux, Kali Linux.
    *   **Unix:** Proprietary, closed-source operating system. Commercial, usually runs on specific architectures. Vendor-driven development. Examples include Solaris, AIX, HP-UX. Unix is not widely used compared to Linux in data engineering, data science, and AI environments.
*   **Linux and Viruses:** While Linux is generally more secure by design due to its permission-based architecture, it is **not entirely immune** to viruses or hacks. They are rare compared to Windows, and enterprise systems still use security and hardening tools.
*   **Linux as a Kernel:** Linux itself is technically a **kernel**, which is the core engine of an operating system. A complete OS combines the kernel with utilities, tools, a shell (like Bash), package managers, and GUI tools. Linux distributions (like Ubuntu, Fedora) are complete operating systems built around the Linux kernel. The kernel manages CPU scheduling, memory allocation, I/O operations, device management, and hardware-software interaction.

## 3. Basic Linux Commands
*   `pwd` (Present Working Directory): Shows the current directory path (e.g., `/home/ubuntu`). `/home/username` is considered the 'home' directory.
*   `uname -a`: Displays system information, including OS name, kernel version, and architecture (e.g., x86_64 for 64-bit).
*   `whoami`: Displays the current username.
*   `clear`: Clears the terminal screen.
*   `Ctrl+L`: Keyboard shortcut to clear the screen in some terminals.
*   `history`: Shows the list of previously executed commands.

## 4. File and Directory Management
*   `mkdir <directory_name>`: Creates a new directory.
*   `mkdir -p <dir1>/<dir2>/<dir3>`: Creates nested directories recursively.
*   `cd <directory_name>`: Changes the current directory.
*   `cd`: Changes to the home directory.
*   `cd ..`: Moves up one directory level.
*   `cd ../..`: Moves up multiple directory levels.
*   `cd -`: Goes to the previously visited directory.
*   `vi <filename>`: Opens/creates a file in the VI editor.
    *   Press `i` to enter **INSERT mode** for typing.
    *   Press `Esc` to exit INSERT mode.
    *   Type `:wq` and press Enter to **save and quit**.
    *   Type `:q!` and press Enter to **quit without saving**.
    *   Type `dd` twice (in command mode after `Esc`) to **delete a line**.
*   `vim`: An upgraded version of `vi` that supports features like arrow key navigation and syntax highlighting. Install with `sudo apt-get install vim`.
*   **Auto-completion with `Tab` key:** Type the first few letters of a file/directory and press `Tab` to auto-complete. Pressing `Tab` multiple times shows available options.
*   `nano <filename>`: Another text editor. You can type directly after opening it.
    *   `Ctrl+X` to exit, then `Y` to save and `Enter` to confirm.
*   **Copy/Paste:**
    *   In the terminal: `Ctrl+Shift+C` to copy, `Ctrl+Shift+V` to paste.
    *   In PuTTY: Select text to copy, right-click to paste.
    *   On Mac: `Ctrl+C` to copy, `Ctrl+V` to paste.
*   `touch <filename>`: Creates an empty file.
*   `rm <filename>`: Removes a file.
*   `rm *.<extension>`: Removes all files with a specific extension (e.g., `*.txt`).
*   `rm <pattern>*`: Removes files starting with a specific pattern (e.g., `H*`).
*   `rm *`: Removes all files in the current directory.
*   `rm -rf <directory_name>`: Recursively removes a directory and its contents (use with extreme caution).
*   `cat <filename>`: Displays the content of a file without opening an editor.
*   `cp <source_file> <destination_file>`: Copies a file.
*   `mv <old_filename> <new_filename>`: Moves or renames a file. (Linux doesn't have a separate `rename` command; `mv` serves this purpose).

## 5. Linking Files
*   **Hard Link (`ln <original_file> <hard_link_name>`):** Creates an alias (another name) for an existing file. Both names point to the **same underlying data block**. Deleting one link does not delete the data unless all links are removed. `ls -lstr` output shows the number of hard links.
*   **Soft Link / Symbolic Link (`ln -s <original_file> <soft_link_name>`):** Creates a new file that points to the **path** of the original file. If the original file is deleted, the soft link breaks. `ls -lstr` output clearly indicates it's a soft link pointing to another file's path.

## 6. Aliases
*   `alias <alias_name>='<command>'`: Creates a custom, shorter command for a longer command or sequence of commands.
*   **Persistence:** Aliases created directly in the terminal are temporary and last only for the current session. To make them permanent, they must be added to a shell configuration file like `.bashrc` or `.profile`.
*   `source ~/.bashrc` or `. ~/.bashrc`: Executes the `.bashrc` file to apply changes immediately without restarting the terminal.

## 7. Background Processes and Process Management
*   **`nohup <command> > <log_file> 2>&1 &`:** Runs a command in the background, immune to hang-ups (e.g., closing the terminal or losing internet connection to a remote server). Output is redirected to a log file.
*   `top`: Displays a dynamic, real-time view of running processes on the system, similar to Windows Task Manager.
*   `ps`: Displays information about currently running processes.
    *   `ps -aux`: Displays processes for **a**ll users, including processes **u**ser owns, and processes not attached to a terminal (`x`), showing background or daemon processes.
*   `tail -f <filename>`: "Follows" a file, displaying new lines as they are added (useful for monitoring logs in real-time).
*   `tail -n <number> <filename>`: Displays the last N lines of a file.
*   `head -n <number> <filename>`: Displays the first N lines of a file. (By default, `head` shows the first 10 lines).
*   `kill -9 <PID>`: Forcefully terminates a process using its Process ID (PID). `PID` can be found using `ps -aux` or `top`.
*   `grep <pattern> <filename(s)>`: Searches for lines containing a specific text pattern within files.
    *   `grep -i <pattern> <filename>`: Performs a case-insensitive search.
    *   `grep -v <pattern> <filename>`: Displays lines that *do not* contain the pattern (inverse match).
    *   `grep <pattern> *.<extension>`: Searches for a pattern across multiple files matching an extension.
    *   `grep -R <pattern> <directory>`: Recursively searches for a pattern within files in a directory and its subdirectories.
    *   **Piping (`|`):** Connects the output of one command as the input to another command (e.g., `ps -aux | grep python`).

## 8. File Download
*   `wget <URL>`: Downloads files from a specified URL to the current directory. Requires network access and firewall permissions.

## 9. System Resource Monitoring & Compression
*   `df -h`: Displays **d**isk **f**ree space in a **h**uman-readable format (e.g., GB, MB) for mounted file systems.
*   `du -sh <directory/file>`: Displays **d**isk **u**sage (size) of a specific directory or file in a **s**ummary and **h**uman-readable format.
*   `zip <output_name>.zip <input_file/directory>`: Compresses files/directories into a `.zip` archive.
    *   `zip -r`: Recursively zips contents of directories.
*   `unzip <archive_name>.zip`: Decompresses a `.zip` archive.
*   `tar -cvf <output_name>.tar <input_file/directory>`: Archives files/directories into a `.tar` archive.
    *   `-c`: Create an archive.
    *   `-v`: Verbosely list files processed.
    *   `-f`: Use archive file.
*   `tar -xvf <archive_name>.tar`: Extracts files from a `.tar` archive.
    *   `-x`: Extract files from an archive.
*   `free -m`: Displays system memory (RAM) usage in **m**egabytes.
*   `free -g`: Displays system memory (RAM) usage in **g**igabytes.
*   `sudo sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`: Command to free up cache/buffer memory (used by system administrators).

## 10. File Content Analysis
*   `wc <filename>`: Displays the **w**ord **c**ount of a file, including lines, words, and characters.
    *   `wc -l <filename>`: Counts only **l**ines.
    *   `wc -w <filename>`: Counts only **w**ords.

    *   `sort -r <filename>`: Sorts in **r**everse alphabetical order.
    *   `sort -n <filename>`: Sorts **n**umerically.

## 11. SSH & SCP (Tools)
*   **SSH (Secure Shell):** Used to connect to remote Linux systems.
    *   `ssh <username>@<IP_address>` or `ssh <username>@<hostname>`: Connects to a remote system.
    *   **PuTTY:** A popular free SSH client for Windows to connect to remote Linux servers.
*   **SCP (Secure Copy):** Used to securely copy files between Linux systems.
    *   `scp <source_path> <username>@<destination_IP>:<destination_path>`: Copies a file from the local machine to a remote machine.
    *   **WinSCP:** A graphical SFTP, FTP, SCP client for Windows. It allows easy drag-and-drop file transfers between local Windows and remote Linux systems.

## 12. `find` Command
*   `find . -name "<pattern>"`: Searches for files or directories by name, starting from the current directory (`.`). Wildcards (`*`) can be used in patterns.
*   `find . -type f -size +10M`: Finds **f**iles (`-type f`) larger than 10 **M**B (`-size +10M`).
*   `find . -mtime -1`: Finds files **m**odified within the last 24 hours (`-1` means less than 1 day old).
*   `find . -empty`: Finds **empty** files or directories.
*   `find . -name "*.tmp" -delete`: Finds files ending with `.tmp` and **deletes** them. (Use `-delete` with extreme caution).
*   **Find vs. Grep:**
    *   `find` **locates files and directories** based on attributes (name, size, type, modification time).
    *   `grep` **searches for text content** *inside* files based on patterns.

## 13. `awk` Command
*   A powerful command-line tool for **processing columns and text**, performing calculations, extracting, and formatting data from files. It can be thought of as a spreadsheet formula for the Linux terminal.
*   `awk '{print}' <filename>`: Prints all lines of a file.
*   `awk '{print $1}' <filename>`: Prints the **first column** of a file (`$1` represents the first column, `$2` for second, etc.).
*   `awk -F',' '{print $1, $3}' <filename>`: Specifies a **field separator** (e.g., comma `-F','`) and prints specific columns.
*   `awk '$2 > 27 {print $1, $3}' <filename>`: Filters rows based on a condition (e.g., column 2 value greater than 27) and prints selected columns.
*   **Formatting Output:** `awk` can format output with headers and custom separators.

## 14. Change Mode (`chmod`)
*   `chmod`: Changes file and directory **permissions (modes)**.
*   **Permission Types:**
    *   **Read (r):** Permission to view content (value: 4).
    *   **Write (w):** Permission to modify content (value: 2).
    *   **Execute (x):** Permission to run a file or access a directory (value: 1).
*   **Permission Categories:**
    *   **User (u):** The owner of the file.
    *   **Group (g):** Members of the file's group.
    *   **Others (o):** Everyone else.
    *   **Root:** Superuser/Admin with full permissions.
*   **Octal Notation:** Permissions are set using a three-digit octal number. Each digit represents the sum of permissions for: **User**, **Group**, and **Others**, respectively.
    *   `0`: No permissions (`---`)
    *   `1`: Execute only (`--x`)
    *   `2`: Write only (`-w-`)
    *   `3`: Write and Execute (`-wx`)
    *   `4`: Read only (`r--`)
    *   `5`: Read and Execute (`r-x`)
    *   `6`: Read and Write (`rw-`)
    *   `7`: Read, Write, and Execute (`rwx`)
*   `chmod 755 <filename>`: Sets read/write/execute for the user, and read/execute for group and others.
*   `chmod 777 <filename>`: Gives read/write/execute permissions to everyone (full permission, generally not recommended for security). Files with full permissions (777) are often highlighted in green.
*   `chmod -R <permissions> <directory>`: Applies permissions **r**ecursively to a directory and its contents.

## 15. Scheduling
*   **Scheduling vs. Automation:** Automation makes a manual process automatic (e.g., Python script reads from DB and writes to file). Scheduling runs an automated task at predefined times (e.g., running the Python script every hour).
*   **Cron:** A time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems.
    *   `crontab -e`: Opens the cron table for editing.
    *   **Cron Formula:** Five fields representing minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week. Wildcards (`*`) and intervals (`*/2` for every 2 minutes) are used. Websites like `crontab.guru` help generate cron expressions.
    *   Cron jobs run in the background.
*   **Airflow:** An open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows (ETL pipelines).
    *   **Installation on Windows (via WSL):** Requires Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to install Ubuntu.
    *   **Key components:** Web server (for UI) and Scheduler (to run DAGs).
    *   **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs):** Workflows are defined as DAGs, typically in Python.
    *   **Operators:** Define individual tasks within a DAG (e.g., `BashOperator` to run shell scripts, `PythonOperator` to run Python functions).
    *   **Metadata Database:** Airflow stores workflow metadata (task status, logs) in a database (defaults to SQLite, can be configured for MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    *   **Scheduling Interval:** Defined within the DAG (e.g., `schedule_interval='*/5 * * * *'` for every 5 minutes).
    *   **`catchup=False`:** Prevents Airflow from running missed past schedule intervals when a DAG is enabled.
    *   **ETL Example:** The masterclass demonstrates an ETL process: reading data from MySQL using Python, performing a transformation, writing to a CSV file, and scheduling this job in Airflow.
*   **`while` loop:** Can be used for basic scheduling within a script, but not recommended for production due to limitations (e.g., tied to terminal session, system shutdown kills it).

## 16. Shell Scripting
*   **Purpose:** Writing scripts (sequences of commands) to automate tasks in Linux, often used for smaller automation, scheduling, or as "wrapper scripts" to orchestrate other programs (like Python scripts, RDBMS operations, email notifications).
*   **File Extension:** Typically `.sh` (e.g., `test.sh`).
*   **Shebang:** The first line `#!/bin/bash` tells the system to execute the script using the Bash interpreter.
*   **Executing a script:** `sh <script_name>.sh`.
*   **Variables:** Define with `NAME=value`. Access with `$NAME` (e.g., `echo "Hello $NAME"`).
*   **User Input:** `read <variable_name>` reads input from the user into a variable.
*   **Conditional Statements (`if-else`):**
    *   `if [ <condition> ]; then <commands>; else <commands>; fi`.
    *   Conditions use operators like `-gt` (greater than).
    *   File existence check: `if [ -f "<filename>" ]; then ... fi`.
*   **Loops (`for` loop):**
    *   `for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do echo "Looping number $i"; done`.
*   **Functions:** Can define and call functions within a shell script.
*   **Command-Line Arguments:** Access arguments passed to the script using `$1`, `$2`, etc. (`$0` is the script name).

**Analogy for Linux's Role:**
Think of Linux as the **backbone of a massive, interconnected city**, like a high-speed railway system. While you, as a resident (developer), might interact with specific buildings (applications) or use a car (your local OS like Windows/Mac) to get around, the underlying railway (Linux servers) is what efficiently moves all the goods (data) and services (applications) throughout the entire metropolis, silently ensuring everything runs smoothly, often without a fancy car (GUI) required for its operation. Mastering Linux commands is like learning to operate the control panel of this railway, allowing you to manage and optimise the flow of information across the entire city.
